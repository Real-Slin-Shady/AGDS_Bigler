# Introduction

## Objectives

This exercise has the goal of providing some information for a
non-experienced user. The following goals should be achieved:

-   Work with R and RStudio.

-   Know basic R objects and classes.

-   Understand how R interacts with files on your computer.

This exercise also has the goal of providing some information about GIT to
non-experienced users. The following goals should be achieved:

-   Organize your workspace for efficient data science projects.

-   Have installed *git* and all R packages used throughout the book.

## Theory

### R

R is a free, open-source programming language and software environment for
statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used, not only among
statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software but also
by scientists in various domains for data analysis, visualization, and
modeling. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that
provides a user-friendly "center stage" for your work in R.

### GIT

*git* is a version control system that keeps track of all changes to your
code, who made them, and when. It allows you to go back to previous changes
and lets you control when to iterate from one state of the code to the
next. The basic unit of *git* is a git repository, where all the code is
contained in a project directory. That\'s why *R projects* work well
with *git*. *git* can also keep track of changes in data, so long as the
data is small and in text format.

# Method

## Install R and RStudio

To use R and RStudio, you have to download and install them first:

To install R, go to the Cran website and download the latest version of R
for your operating system. Please use
this: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/){style="color: rgb(37, 37, 37);"}

To install RStudio, go to the RStudio website and download the latest
version of RStudio for your operating system. Please use
this: [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop){style="color: rgb(37, 37, 37);"}

If you want to learn programming in R, please use the manuals or books from
the following links:

[Manuals:]{.underline}

<https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html>

[Books:]{.underline}

<https://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-books.html>

## GIT

To use *git*, you have to download and install them first:

-   Create a GitHub account and sign in.

    <https://github.com> 

-   Follow the *git* download and installation instructions for your OS as
    outlined:

     [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads){style="color: rgb(37, 37, 37);"}

-   Connect your GitHub account with *git* locally, using SSH keys. 

-   Log into GitHub in your browser and create a new repository.

-   Clone your repository.

-   Create a new R-Project from a GitHub repository.

If you need more information, please take a closer look to these manuals:

# Discussion

It might be really complicated if you do it the first time. But it is very
important, and we assure you that you will not regret it. The time you need
to understand this task is well spent!
